Address all letters to his address, given at the end\nof this document.\n     -- Russell\n\n  FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY:  THWARTING THE STATE VIA\n                     TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Given at the Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987\n\n\n     You   know,   technology--and   particularly   computer\ntechnology--has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir-\ncles.  We tend to think of Orwell's 1984, or Terry Gilliam's\nBrazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin's\nslave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-\nphisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on\nhis \"enemies list.\"  Or, we recognize that for the price  of\na  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of\nsound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by\na  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-\nlongings if it beeps.\n\n     But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there\nwere cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with\nclubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for\neavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.\nThough  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the\nevil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.\n\n     In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-\ning  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from\nthose who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors\nthe  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-\nnot).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the\nmerit  of  the  new  (over  the sluggish (who cling to time-\ntested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-\nscribe government bureaucracy than \"dull\" and \"sluggish\"?\n\n     One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology\nover tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable\ncrossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably\nand lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if\nthat  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike\nthe longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could\nget  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no\nformal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required\nelaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to\nachieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow\ncould simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the\narrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-\nget.)\n\n     Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights\nlikely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government\nsoldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was\nplain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves\nnot only against one another, but against their governmental\nmasters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-\npiercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the\nmedieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and\nCrossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-\ntively, for its unlawful possession.\n\n     Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology\nlike  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the\nhandgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced\nmachine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal\nand inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45\ncalled \"the equalizer.\"  A frail dance-hall hostess with one\nin  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself\nagainst the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-\nments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the\nrepeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  \"a  man  on\nhorseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be\ncaptured.\"  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon\nflintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a\ntrue one.\n\n     Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher\n(with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-\nalent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can\nsuch  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's\nown possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-\nchange   information   over   an   insecure   communications\nchannel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or\nskywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously\nmet  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-\nputer, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY\nX-MP  can't  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should\nbe economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-\ncations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.\nTechnology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it\nwill  have  totally demolished government's control over in-\nformation transfer.\n\n     I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-\nics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is\ncalled the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman\nwho  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact\nthat, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very\nlarge  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the\ntwo prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    \"Ex-\ntremely\"  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100\ndigits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-\neral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful\ncomputer now in existence.\n\n     The  \"public\" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-\nuct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-\ntor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *\n(q-1) + 1}.  The \"private\" part of the key consists  of  the\nother factor  y.\n\n     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned\ninto an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple\nA=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer\nis then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting\ninteger is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver\ndecrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y\n(modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always\nyield the original number started with.\n\n     What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why\nit  is  called  \"public-key\"  cryptography,\"  is  that I can\nopenly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while\nkeeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me\nan encrypted message, namely\n                       x\n                     a    (mod pq)  ,\nbut only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking\nwhat  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the\nresult (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher\nkeys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust\neach other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-\nchange  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and\ndisseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining\nthe secrecy of his own  y.\n\n     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a \"dig-\nital signature,\" to enable one to authenticate the source of\na given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,\nI raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod\nyour pq)  and send that.\n\n    However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and\nraise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my\npq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and\nsend this, then even after you have normally \"decrypted\" the\nmessage,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you\nthen raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result\n(mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-\nginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I\ncould have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret\ny).\n\n     And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-\nday tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of\npersonal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that\nAmerican schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-\nputers  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in\nfact, because there are things computers can do  which  will\ninterest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-\ncisely these students who one generation hence will be going\nhead-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the\nSoviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to\nteach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning\nballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal\ncomputer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying\nmachine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of\ntext,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this\nweren't threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the\ncopy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but\nunbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-\ncessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few\ncopying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-\nsively than machine guns are in the United States.)\n\n     Now  the  \"conservative\" position is that we should not\nsell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use\nthem  in weapons systems.  The \"liberal\" position is that we\nshould sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and\ncooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don't make the sale, there\nwill certainly be some other nation willing to.\n\n     For my part, I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarian\nposition should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and\nif  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn't\nwork load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over\nMoscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-\nscription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this\nis not a position that has gained much support among members\nof  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-\nter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters, we\nare political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a\nparticular  goal may not look anything like what most people\nwould consider a \"straight line.\"    Taking  a  long  enough\nworld-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-\nment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to\nthe enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of\nthe Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen\nmissiles aimed at Moscow.\n\n     But  there's  the rub:  A \"long enough\" world view does\nsuggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the\nsimply  stupid  will \"get what they deserve,\" but what's not\nimmediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being\nkilled, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.\n\n    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-\ntack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,\nfunctioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to\nhamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political\ngradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have\npatchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire\nand spit.  The state not only taxes us to  \"feed  the  poor\"\nwhile also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive\nup food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-\nsidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-\ncrease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness\nthe fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as\npotentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years\nago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy\nrisked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase\nwas called the \"moral equivalent of war\" and the Feds  swung\ninto  action.    For the first time in American history, the\nspeed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-\ncame an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of\noil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-\ncan oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who\nsell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our\ngrossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that\ngovernment  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has\nlowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking\nto raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,\nwhat  can we call this except the \"moral equivalent of civil\nwar--the government against its own people?\"\n\n     And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-\nine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to\ncourt  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too\ncheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be\ncompelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it\nbe punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?\n\n     So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of\nhundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we\ncertainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of\nstability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there\nexists  almost  a  \"black  hole\"  effect in the evolution of\nnation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-\ndom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state\nwarps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to\nthe degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes\nall but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen\nin the area of so-called \"welfare\" payments.  When those who\nsup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those\nwhose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible\nchoice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-\ning  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go\ndown to the nearest \"welfare\" office, find just  two  people\non  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form\na voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question\nof who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor.\n\n     So essentially those who love liberty need an \"edge\" of\nsome  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-\nously  can't  use  the  altruists'  \"other-directedness\"  of\n\"work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of\na billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world.\"\nRecognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it\nis nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture.\nIf you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a\n\"cause,\" caring only enough for their personal welfare so as\nto  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue\nworking--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy\nto draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-\npeal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or\nlibertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight\nand say something like, \"Listen, follow me as I enunciate my\nnoble \"cause,\" contribute your money to support the \"cause,\"\ngive  up  your  free  time  to  work for the \"cause,\" strive\nselflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your\nchildren are dead) maybe your children's children will actu-\nally  live under egoism\"--you'd all think I'd gone mad.  And\nof course you'd be right.  Because the point I'm  trying  to\nmake is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,\nwhen, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it\nprofitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only\nthen.\n\n     While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-\ntical  action, I don't believe that it is the only, nor even\nnecessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing\nfreedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the\ninvestment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-\ning  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all\nforms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who's in-\nterested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them\nunilaterally.\n\n     There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to\nthe Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-\nready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with\nthe saying, you might well feel that you've heard  it  often\nenough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,\nand moreover, that maybe you're even tired of hearing it.  I\nshall therefore repeat it now:\n\n     If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him\nfor a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him\nfor a lifetime.\n\n     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of\na  \"workfare\"  vs.  \"welfare\"  context;  namely, that if you\ngenuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him\nhow to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.\nAnd of course this is true, if only because the next time he\nis hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even\nable to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how\nto fish, he is completely self sufficient.\n\n     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order\ncontent of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to\nglean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it\nagain.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist\nslant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-\ntivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry\nbeggars as we may encounter.\n\n     But consider:\n\n     Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish,  but  he\ndoes  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,\nhave often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country\nbecause  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and\nthey ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose\nthe  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering\nfishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first\nthing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type\ncategorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise\nthat  every  trade  must  have a \"winner\" and a \"loser;\" the\nidea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the\n\"expense\" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this\nscenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-\nthing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-\nished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information\n(rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum\ngame.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  \"law  of\ndiminishing   returns,\"   the  \"first  and  second  laws  of\nthermodynamics\"--all those \"laws\" which constrain our possi-\nbilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that's\nanarchy!\n\n     Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry\nEskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his\nnation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish\ncontain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he\ntells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--and\neven  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people's\nhealth to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing\nadults.   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought\nto be government property, and therefore it is the  function\nof the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-\nment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-\nously extends to competent adults the \"benefits\" it provides\nto children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,\nall-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need\nnot  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior\nthought physically risky or morally \"naughty.\"  But, in  any\ncase,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-\nlates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of\nhis was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of \"pos-\nsession of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.\"\n\n     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely\noppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an\naffront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-\nther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-\nary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting\nthis tyrant's goal.  (Your rationale may be \"altruistic\"  in\nthe   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or\n\"egoistic\" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the\noppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-\nhaps even other motives.)\n\n     But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to\nyour \"cause,\" you're not about to mount a military campaign,\nor  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.\nHowever, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-\nformation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a\nhundredfold.    I say \"literally,\" because for a fraction of\nthe effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to\nsmuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a\nhundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-\ngeted government, like present-day America, at least permits\nopen  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-\nstricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government\nattempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then\nyou will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write\nyour  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to\nyour mythical Eskimo's public-key parameters.  But as far as\nincreasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine\nnonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others\nre-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you\nhave not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-\neological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-\ncided.  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from  \"Freedom  in  an\nUnfree World\" that the success of any endeavor is in general\ninversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-\nsion is necessary to its fulfilment.\n\n     If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has\nbeen dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,\nLincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .\nKhadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped\nby  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and\nWozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-\nvasive, and not nearly so bloody.\n\n     And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTech\nProject.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-\nslave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-\nwork spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize\nfreedom for ourselves.\n\n     But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at\npresent)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government\nwants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-\nture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-\nple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor\nwhen government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to\ncommit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that\nfact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.\nThis law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but\nit does indicate how government thinks.\n\n     Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed\npose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone\nwho  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the \"underground\nrailroad\" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as\nthe sovereign government of the United States of America  at\nthat time found the buying and selling of human beings quite\nas  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-\nlarly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to\nferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,\nalcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-\nogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents\nfor his \"crime\"--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life\nwhen  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this\ndrug.\n\n     So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-\nconspirator  and pardoned felon . . . \"Let me make one thing\nperfectly clear:\"  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,\nparticipate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no\nmatter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid\nsuch  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-\ntional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological\nprocesses,  and some of these processes (like flying a plane\nor manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-\ncensing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is\nneeded  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-\nself.\n\n     So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and\ndespair,  thinking,  \"Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of\nthis State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian\nbefore  I'll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my\ngoddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery\"--recognize\nthat  such  is not the case.  There exist ways to make your-\nself free.\n\n     If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project,\nyou are welcome to give me your name and address--or a  fake\nname  and  mail  drop, for that matter--and you'll go on the\nmailing list for my erratically-published newsletter.    Any\nfriends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested\nare welcome as well.  I'm not even asking for stamped  self-\naddressed envelopes, since my printer can handle mailing la-\nbels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared\nwith  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out.   If you\nshould have an idea to share, or even a  useful  product  to\nplug,  I'll be glad to have you write it up for publication.\nEven if you want to be the proverbial \"free rider\" and  just\nbenefit  from  what others contribute--you're still welcome:\nEverything will be public domain; feel free to  copy  it  or\ngive it away (or sell it, for that matter, 'cause if you can\nget  money  for  it while I'm taking full-page ads trying to\ngive it away, you're certainly entitled to  your  capitalist\nprofit . . .)  Anyway, every application of these principles\nshould make the world just a little freer, and I'm certainly\nwilling to underwrite that, at least for the forseeable  fu-\nture.\n\n     I  will leave you with one final thought:  If you don't\nlearn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they\noutlaw  swords,  then you sure as HELL ought to learn before\nthey outlaw plowshares too.\n\n                                       --Chuck Hammill\n\n                                 THE LIBERTECH PROJECT\n                                 3194 Queensbury Drive\n                               Los Angeles, California\n                                                 90064\n                                          310-836-4157\n\n                                    hammill@netcom.com\n\n[The above LiberTech address was updated December 1992, with the\n permission of Chuck Hammill, by Russell Whitaker]\n\nThose interested in the issues raised in this piece should participate\nin at least these newsgroups:\n\n                alt.privacy\n                alt.security.pgp\n                comp.org.eff.talk\n                sci.crypt\n\nA copy of the RSA-based public key encryption program, PGP 2.1 (Pretty\nGood Privacy), can be obtained at various ftp sites around the world.\nOne such site is gate.demon.co.uk, where an MS-DOS version can be had by\nanonymous ftp as pgp22.zip in /pub/pgp.\n\nVersions for other operating systems, including UNIX variants\nand Macintosh, are also available.

Address all letters to his address, given at the end\nof this document.\n     -- Russell\n\n  FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY:  THWARTING THE STATE VIA\n                     TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Given at the Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987\n\n\n     You   know,   technology--and   particularly   computer\ntechnology--has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir-\ncles.  We tend to think of Orwell's 1984, or Terry Gilliam's\nBrazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin's\nslave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-\nphisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on\nhis \"enemies list.\"  Or, we recognize that for the price  of\na  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of\nsound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by\na  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-\nlongings if it beeps.\n\n     But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there\nwere cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with\nclubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for\neavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.\nThough  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the\nevil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.\n\n     In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-\ning  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from\nthose who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors\nthe  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-\nnot).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the\nmerit  of  the  new  (over  the sluggish (who cling to time-\ntested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-\nscribe government bureaucracy than \"dull\" and \"sluggish\"?\n\n     One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology\nover tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable\ncrossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably\nand lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if\nthat  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike\nthe longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could\nget  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no\nformal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required\nelaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to\nachieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow\ncould simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the\narrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-\nget.)\n\n     Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights\nlikely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government\nsoldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was\nplain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves\nnot only against one another, but against their governmental\nmasters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-\npiercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the\nmedieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and\nCrossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-\ntively, for its unlawful possession.\n\n     Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology\nlike  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the\nhandgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced\nmachine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal\nand inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45\ncalled \"the equalizer.\"  A frail dance-hall hostess with one\nin  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself\nagainst the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-\nments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the\nrepeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  \"a  man  on\nhorseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be\ncaptured.\"  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon\nflintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a\ntrue one.\n\n     Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher\n(with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-\nalent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can\nsuch  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's\nown possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-\nchange   information   over   an   insecure   communications\nchannel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or\nskywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously\nmet  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-\nputer, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY\nX-MP  can't  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should\nbe economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-\ncations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.\nTechnology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it\nwill  have  totally demolished government's control over in-\nformation transfer.\n\n     I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-\nics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is\ncalled the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman\nwho  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact\nthat, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very\nlarge  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the\ntwo prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    \"Ex-\ntremely\"  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100\ndigits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-\neral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful\ncomputer now in existence.\n\n     The  \"public\" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-\nuct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-\ntor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *\n(q-1) + 1}.  The \"private\" part of the key consists  of  the\nother factor  y.\n\n     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned\ninto an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple\nA=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer\nis then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting\ninteger is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver\ndecrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y\n(modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always\nyield the original number started with.\n\n     What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why\nit  is  called  \"public-key\"  cryptography,\"  is  that I can\nopenly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while\nkeeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me\nan encrypted message, namely\n                       x\n                     a    (mod pq)  ,\nbut only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking\nwhat  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the\nresult (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher\nkeys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust\neach other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-\nchange  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and\ndisseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining\nthe secrecy of his own  y.\n\n     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a \"dig-\nital signature,\" to enable one to authenticate the source of\na given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,\nI raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod\nyour pq)  and send that.\n\n    However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and\nraise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my\npq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and\nsend this, then even after you have normally \"decrypted\" the\nmessage,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you\nthen raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result\n(mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-\nginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I\ncould have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret\ny).\n\n     And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-\nday tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of\npersonal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that\nAmerican schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-\nputers  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in\nfact, because there are things computers can do  which  will\ninterest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-\ncisely these students who one generation hence will be going\nhead-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the\nSoviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to\nteach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning\nballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal\ncomputer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying\nmachine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of\ntext,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this\nweren't threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the\ncopy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but\nunbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-\ncessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few\ncopying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-\nsively than machine guns are in the United States.)\n\n     Now  the  \"conservative\" position is that we should not\nsell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use\nthem  in weapons systems.  The \"liberal\" position is that we\nshould sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and\ncooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don't make the sale, there\nwill certainly be some other nation willing to.\n\n     For my part, I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarian\nposition should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and\nif  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn't\nwork load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over\nMoscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-\nscription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this\nis not a position that has gained much support among members\nof  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-\nter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters, we\nare political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a\nparticular  goal may not look anything like what most people\nwould consider a \"straight line.\"    Taking  a  long  enough\nworld-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-\nment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to\nthe enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of\nthe Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen\nmissiles aimed at Moscow.\n\n     But  there's  the rub:  A \"long enough\" world view does\nsuggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the\nsimply  stupid  will \"get what they deserve,\" but what's not\nimmediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being\nkilled, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.\n\n    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-\ntack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,\nfunctioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to\nhamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political\ngradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have\npatchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire\nand spit.  The state not only taxes us to  \"feed  the  poor\"\nwhile also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive\nup food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-\nsidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-\ncrease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness\nthe fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as\npotentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years\nago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy\nrisked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase\nwas called the \"moral equivalent of war\" and the Feds  swung\ninto  action.    For the first time in American history, the\nspeed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-\ncame an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of\noil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-\ncan oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who\nsell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our\ngrossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that\ngovernment  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has\nlowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking\nto raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,\nwhat  can we call this except the \"moral equivalent of civil\nwar--the government against its own people?\"\n\n     And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-\nine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to\ncourt  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too\ncheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be\ncompelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it\nbe punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?\n\n     So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of\nhundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we\ncertainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of\nstability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there\nexists  almost  a  \"black  hole\"  effect in the evolution of\nnation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-\ndom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state\nwarps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to\nthe degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes\nall but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen\nin the area of so-called \"welfare\" payments.  When those who\nsup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those\nwhose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible\nchoice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-\ning  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go\ndown to the nearest \"welfare\" office, find just  two  people\non  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form\na voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question\nof who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor.\n\n     So essentially those who love liberty need an \"edge\" of\nsome  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-\nously  can't  use  the  altruists'  \"other-directedness\"  of\n\"work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of\na billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world.\"\nRecognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it\nis nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture.\nIf you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a\n\"cause,\" caring only enough for their personal welfare so as\nto  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue\nworking--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy\nto draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-\npeal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or\nlibertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight\nand say something like, \"Listen, follow me as I enunciate my\nnoble \"cause,\" contribute your money to support the \"cause,\"\ngive  up  your  free  time  to  work for the \"cause,\" strive\nselflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your\nchildren are dead) maybe your children's children will actu-\nally  live under egoism\"--you'd all think I'd gone mad.  And\nof course you'd be right.  Because the point I'm  trying  to\nmake is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,\nwhen, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it\nprofitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only\nthen.\n\n     While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-\ntical  action, I don't believe that it is the only, nor even\nnecessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing\nfreedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the\ninvestment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-\ning  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all\nforms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who's in-\nterested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them\nunilaterally.\n\n     There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to\nthe Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-\nready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with\nthe saying, you might well feel that you've heard  it  often\nenough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,\nand moreover, that maybe you're even tired of hearing it.  I\nshall therefore repeat it now:\n\n     If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him\nfor a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him\nfor a lifetime.\n\n     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of\na  \"workfare\"  vs.  \"welfare\"  context;  namely, that if you\ngenuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him\nhow to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.\nAnd of course this is true, if only because the next time he\nis hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even\nable to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how\nto fish, he is completely self sufficient.\n\n     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order\ncontent of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to\nglean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it\nagain.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist\nslant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-\ntivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry\nbeggars as we may encounter.\n\n     But consider:\n\n     Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish,  but  he\ndoes  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,\nhave often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country\nbecause  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and\nthey ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose\nthe  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering\nfishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first\nthing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type\ncategorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise\nthat  every  trade  must  have a \"winner\" and a \"loser;\" the\nidea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the\n\"expense\" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this\nscenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-\nthing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-\nished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information\n(rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum\ngame.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  \"law  of\ndiminishing   returns,\"   the  \"first  and  second  laws  of\nthermodynamics\"--all those \"laws\" which constrain our possi-\nbilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that's\nanarchy!\n\n     Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry\nEskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his\nnation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish\ncontain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he\ntells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--and\neven  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people's\nhealth to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing\nadults.   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought\nto be government property, and therefore it is the  function\nof the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-\nment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-\nously extends to competent adults the \"benefits\" it provides\nto children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,\nall-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need\nnot  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior\nthought physically risky or morally \"naughty.\"  But, in  any\ncase,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-\nlates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of\nhis was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of \"pos-\nsession of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.\"\n\n     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely\noppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an\naffront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-\nther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-\nary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting\nthis tyrant's goal.  (Your rationale may be \"altruistic\"  in\nthe   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or\n\"egoistic\" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the\noppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-\nhaps even other motives.)\n\n     But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to\nyour \"cause,\" you're not about to mount a military campaign,\nor  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.\nHowever, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-\nformation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a\nhundredfold.    I say \"literally,\" because for a fraction of\nthe effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to\nsmuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a\nhundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-\ngeted government, like present-day America, at least permits\nopen  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-\nstricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government\nattempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then\nyou will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write\nyour  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to\nyour mythical Eskimo's public-key parameters.  But as far as\nincreasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine\nnonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others\nre-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you\nhave not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-\neological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-\ncided.  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from  \"Freedom  in  an\nUnfree World\" that the success of any endeavor is in general\ninversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-\nsion is necessary to its fulfilment.\n\n     If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has\nbeen dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,\nLincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .\nKhadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped\nby  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and\nWozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-\nvasive, and not nearly so bloody.\n\n     And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTech\nProject.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-\nslave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-\nwork spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize\nfreedom for ourselves.\n\n     But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at\npresent)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government\nwants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-\nture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-\nple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor\nwhen government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to\ncommit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that\nfact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.\nThis law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but\nit does indicate how government thinks.\n\n     Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed\npose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone\nwho  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the \"underground\nrailroad\" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as\nthe sovereign government of the United States of America  at\nthat time found the buying and selling of human beings quite\nas  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-\nlarly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to\nferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,\nalcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-\nogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents\nfor his \"crime\"--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life\nwhen  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this\ndrug.\n\n     So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-\nconspirator  and pardoned felon . . . \"Let me make one thing\nperfectly clear:\"  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,\nparticipate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no\nmatter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid\nsuch  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-\ntional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological\nprocesses,  and some of these processes (like flying a plane\nor manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-\ncensing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is\nneeded  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-\nself.\n\n     So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and\ndespair,  thinking,  \"Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of\nthis State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian\nbefore  I'll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my\ngoddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery\"--recognize\nthat  such  is not the case.  There exist ways to make your-\nself free.\n\n     If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project,\nyou are welcome to give me your name and address--or a  fake\nname  and  mail  drop, for that matter--and you'll go on the\nmailing list for my erratically-published newsletter.    Any\nfriends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested\nare welcome as well.  I'm not even asking for stamped  self-\naddressed envelopes, since my printer can handle mailing la-\nbels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared\nwith  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out.   If you\nshould have an idea to share, or even a  useful  product  to\nplug,  I'll be glad to have you write it up for publication.\nEven if you want to be the proverbial \"free rider\" and  just\nbenefit  from  what others contribute--you're still welcome:\nEverything will be public domain; feel free to  copy  it  or\ngive it away (or sell it, for that matter, 'cause if you can\nget  money  for  it while I'm taking full-page ads trying to\ngive it away, you're certainly entitled to  your  capitalist\nprofit . . .)  Anyway, every application of these principles\nshould make the world just a little freer, and I'm certainly\nwilling to underwrite that, at least for the forseeable  fu-\nture.\n\n     I  will leave you with one final thought:  If you don't\nlearn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they\noutlaw  swords,  then you sure as HELL ought to learn before\nthey outlaw plowshares too.\n\n                                       --Chuck Hammill\n\n                                 THE LIBERTECH PROJECT\n                                 3194 Queensbury Drive\n                               Los Angeles, California\n                                                 90064\n                                          310-836-4157\n\n                                    hammill@netcom.com\n\n[The above LiberTech address was updated December 1992, with the\n permission of Chuck Hammill, by Russell Whitaker]\n\nThose interested in the issues raised in this piece should participate\nin at least these newsgroups:\n\n                alt.privacy\n                alt.security.pgp\n                comp.org.eff.talk\n                sci.crypt\n\nA copy of the RSA-based public key encryption program, PGP 2.1 (Pretty\nGood Privacy), can be obtained at various ftp sites around the world.\nOne such site is gate.demon.co.uk, where an MS-DOS version can be had by\nanonymous ftp as pgp22.zip in /pub/pgp.\n\nVersions for other operating systems, including UNIX variants\nand Macintosh, are also available.

The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points,\nnot to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.\nThe non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.\n\nI personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.\nThe first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat.\nThis has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I\ncontend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that\nthe flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends,\ndinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate\nflair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually\nthat it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and\nboring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)\n\nThe other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has\na few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and \ntedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly\nidentify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone's\npersonal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.\n(Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads\nto a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING.\nFinally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul my\nbig dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which\nactually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter\nto my use and flamage in general.\n\nIn summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.

The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points,\nnot to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.\nThe non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.\n\nI personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.\nThe first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat.\nThis has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I\ncontend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that\nthe flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends,\ndinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate\nflair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually\nthat it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and\nboring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)\n\nThe other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has\na few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and \ntedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly\nidentify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone's\npersonal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.\n(Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads\nto a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING.\nFinally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul my\nbig dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which\nactually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter\nto my use and flamage in general.\n\nIn summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may\nbe the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily\nweaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor\napplicable.  You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a\nflatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I'll bet you and your \nmotorcycle lean to the outside while turning.  The same goes for anyone\nwho looks like you, too.\n\n\n-----\nTommy McGuire\nmcguire@cs.utexas.edu\nmcguire@austin.ibm.com\n\n\"...I will append an appropriate disclaimer to outgoing public information,\nidentifying it as personal and as independent of IBM....\"\n\n\n\nPlease select a topic that better corresponds with the article.

It was explained that two news photographers were found \non the compound earlier this morning without permission.  It was explained \nto the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer \nturning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous \nby a Texas Ranger surveying the site. (!)  \n\nThe two photographers were said to be currently in jail and \nthe press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines.  \nIt was also emphasized that the survey of the \"crime\" scene at this \npoint was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere.\nThe press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the \nsite has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case.  \n\nThat is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my \nmemory.  I bring this up because I haven't seen anyone else note it \nand I haven't seen the regular newscasts mention it.

It was explained that two news photographers were found \non the compound earlier this morning without permission.  It was explained \nto the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer \nturning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous \nby a Texas Ranger surveying the site. (!)  \n\nThe two photographers were said to be currently in jail and \nthe press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines.  \nIt was also emphasized that the survey of the \"crime\" scene at this \npoint was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere.\nThe press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the \nsite has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case.  \n\nThat is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my \nmemory.  I bring this up because I haven't seen anyone else note it \nand I haven't seen the regular newscasts mention it.  It will \nprobably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow.\n\nMy opinions:\n-----------\nI find this disturbing.

I love this topic, as some of you regulars know.\n\nSo, having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk\nabout it; I shall.\n\nI feel that we as a community of people have unique resources\nto deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate\non the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent \nas medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and \nprobably more.  I do not believe that the general public understands\nthe impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absence\nof such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort.\n\nI believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only\ncommunicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media.\n\nA well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science\nvariables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long\nexpenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educational\nto the general public.  The objective of such an effort would be to \ncompile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical\njournals which would address each major life science area.

I love this topic, as some of you regulars know.\n\nSo, having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk\nabout it; I shall.\n\nI feel that we as a community of people have unique resources\nto deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate\non the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent \nas medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and \nprobably more.  I do not believe that the general public understands\nthe impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absence\nof such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort.\n\nI believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only\ncommunicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media.\n\nA well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science\nvariables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long\nexpenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educational\nto the general public.  The objective of such an effort would be to \ncompile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical\njournals which would address each major life science area.  In addition,\nideas for further research and development could be put forward for\nthe general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take\npart in the excitement of exploration.\n\nIndividuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week\nto running literature searches and finding journal articles.
